# # Telecom customer churn prediction

## Overview
In this project, the goal is to predict customer churn for a telecom company using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. By accurately identifying at-risk customers, targeted retention strategies can be implemented, enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting revenue.

* Segment 0 has high monthly charges and long tenure, which may indicate high-value customers who are willing to pay more for the service and have been loyal to the company for a longer time.

* Segment 1 has low monthly charges and short tenure, which may indicate that these customers are not as valuable to the company and may be more likely to churn.

* Segment 2 has high monthly charges but short tenure, which may indicate that these customers are not fully satisfied with the service and may be at a higher risk of churning.

* Segment 3 has low monthly charges and long tenure, which may indicate customers who have been loyal to the company for a long time despite lower pricing.
