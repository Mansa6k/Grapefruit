# # Telecom customer churn prediction

## Overview
In this project, I aim to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. I will analyze customer data and develop a machine learning model that can identify customers at risk of leaving the company. By identifying these customers, the company can take appropriate action to retain them, improving customer satisfaction and increasing overall revenue.
